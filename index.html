                <h1>Pizza</h1>
                <p> pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some
                    combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other
                    ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a
                    very high temperature—and served hot.</p>

                <h1>Burger</h1>
                <p>hamburger, also called burger, ground beef. The term is applied variously to (1) a patty of ground
                    beef, sometimes called hamburg steak, Salisbury steak, or Vienna steak, (2) a sandwich consisting of
                    a patty of ground beef served within a split bread roll, with various garnishes, or (3) the ground
                    beef itself, which is used as a base in many sauces, casseroles, terrines, and the like.</p>

                    <h1>Chicken fry</h1>
                    <p>Frying chicken is a quick and simple way of cooking chicken where the cooking can be accomplished
                        by the use of two different methods, pan-frying and deep-fat frying. Both methods work on the
                        principle of using hot oil to cook the chicken, producing chicken with a crispy brown outside
                        and juicy, flavorful meat inside. The chicken is generally coated with a thin layer of flour,
                        crumbs or batter. Chicken pieces are generally used for frying, rather than a whole chicken.</p>
